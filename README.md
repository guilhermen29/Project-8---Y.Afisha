# 🎬 Y.Afisha — Marketing Performance Analysis (Cohorts, CAC, LTV, ROMI)

This project conducts a complete end-to-end marketing analysis for the Y.Afisha ticket service.
The goal is to understand user acquisition efficiency, retention patterns, engagement, revenue, and marketing return on investment using real transactional and cost data.

The analysis includes:

* Cohort creation and retention metrics
* User lifecycle and revenue tracking
* CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) per channel
* LTV (Lifetime Value) by cohort and by traffic source
* ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment)
* Conversion funnel evaluation
* Complete data visualizations with insights
* Clean, reproducible Python pipeline

# 🧠 Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate how effective Y.Afisha’s marketing investment is.
The analysis identifies:

* Which traffic sources bring the most valuable users
* How long it takes for users to pay back acquisition cost
* Retention and decay patterns
* Cohort behavior over time
* Whether the project is profitable or needs optimization

# 📊 Key Metrics Calculated

1. **CAC – Customer Acquisition Cost**
   Measures how much the company spends to acquire one user per channel.

2. **LTV – Lifetime Value**
   Total revenue generated by a user over time (cohort-based and source-based).

3. **ROMI – Return on Marketing Investment**
   Formula:
   ROMI = (LTV – CAC) / CAC

4. **Conversion Funnel**
   From visit → first purchase.

5. **Retention Analysis**
   Tracks user behavior across months since first purchase.

# 🧹 Data Pipeline

**1. Data Cleaning**

* Removed duplicates
* Checked missing values
* Converted date columns
* Standardized traffic source IDs

**2. Feature Engineering**

* Cohort assignment
* Month offset calculation
* Joining revenue and cost datasets

**3. Metric Computation**

* CAC by month and traffic source
* LTV by cohort
* ROMI by channel
* Funnel and retention metrics

**4. Visualization**

* Heatmaps for cohorts and LTV
* Line charts for CAC and revenue
* Bar charts for ROMI and funnel performance

---

# 📈 Main Insights (Example)

* Organic users had the best long-term profitability.
* Paid channels recovered CAC only after 3–5 months.
* Facebook + YouTube showed strong ROMI performance.
* Retention dropped significantly after month 2.
* Some campaigns were negative ROMI and require optimization.
